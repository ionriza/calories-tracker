# calories-tracker

For 19th March class we will have to complete the following tasks:

- Adapt the `home` function from `app.py` to calculate the calories by breakfast, lunch and dinner, and also the sum of
calories by day.
- Display the foods/portions by breakfast, lunch and dinner in a prettier way (maybe an ordered/unordered list)
- Create a new function in `app.py` for the `Add food` functionality. The function should both support
the rendering of the `Add food` template and also the creation (POST) of the food (a `Food` entry in the database).
- Create the above `Add food` HTML template that will contain an HTML form matching the `Food` model attributes.
- Create a navbar (using the Bootstrap Nav component) and add two items: 
  - Home (will create a new Welcome page describing what the app does)
  - Log Food (will replace the existing `home` function)
